				<h3>Funding to Make It Happen</h3>
				<p>Do you have an inspirational idea that could change our community but lack the resources to make it happen?</p>
				<p>BSA Inspire is the solution. We provide funding to students working on community projects, making an otherwise unattainable idea into reality.</p>
				<p>We are looking for innovative students with exciting ideas. BSA may reward up to $1,000 to projects fitting our project criteria.</p>

				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
				<p>BSA Inspire seeks to fund long-term, lasting projects that benefit the Brown or Providence community. For this reason, we will not fund events - even if they are recurring.</p>
				<p>BSA will award up to $1,000 of reimbursable funding per project. If the project is seeking funding aside from BSA Inspire, applicants must disclose where else they will seek funding.</p>
				<p>At the end of each semester, we ask recepients to provide a documentation of their progress. This could be a video, photos with interviews, a blog maintained throughout the semester, or a similar project. This way, we can showcase your success and hopefully inspire other students.</p>

				<h3>Application Process</h3>
				<p>We offer five rounds of applications. In the fall, they are October 30th and November 30th. In the spring, they are February 28th, March 30th, and April 30th.</p>
				<p>There is no advantage to applying in fall versus spring but we recommend applying in the earlier rounds within either semester.</p>
				<p>Each person or group may only apply once per semester. If your application is rejected, you may reapply once more in the same semester.</p>

				<h3>Community Events</h3>
				<p>BSA is proud to sponsor "Nothing Productive," a mockumentary web series about a chaos-prone, blissfully dysfunctional student group getting nothing done.</p><p>
				"Nothing Productive" follows eight oddballs around their equally oddball university, in a story about the good, the bad, and the ugly things that happen when you get stuck in a room with the same eight people every week...especially when all eight are insane.</p>
				<p>Produced and performed entirely by Brown students, the series stars Emma Brandt '14, Max Genecov '15, Austen Hyde '14, Ben Jones '13, Drew Kunas '12, Gillian Michaleson '14, Cheno Pinter '14, and Allison Schaaff '14, and is produced by Kate Doyle '12, Andrew Favaloro 'GS, and Josh Bloom '14.</p>

				<h3>Past Events</h3>
				<p>In Spring 2012, BSA wsas proud to be a major financial sponsor for China Care's Benefit Showcase. We celebrated our communities of family with children from China</p>
				<p>Together, we were able to raise over $8000 that went towards funding surgeries for orphans in China.</p>
				<p>--------------------------------------</p>
				<p>In Fall 2011, BSA sponsored the 4th Annual Dash for Diabetes event. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and with this race we came one step closer to promoting healthy lifestyles and curing a condition that affects more than 23 million Americans.</p>
				<p>With the help of the Brown and Providence community, we raised more than $3000 to fund diabetes research. <a href="http://students.brown.edu/dash/cause.html">Learn more</a> about our cause.</p>

				<h3>CV Starr Fellowship</h3>
