                    we’d like to offer some advice on how to make the transition into college a little easier for you and your
                    parents. BSA is an official student run organization that provides business experience to undergrads and
                    offers needed products and services to the University community. So, before you run out the door to
                    buy a mini fridge or panic about doing laundry, let us offer you some alternatives.</p>

                    That overflowing laundry basket in your dorm room won’t be your
                    problem when you sign up for BSA’s laundry service. With our on-campus
                    laundry service, you won’t have to worry about fitting the hassle
                    laundry into your busy schedule. All you have to do is drop off your
                    dirty laundry in the conveniently located Campus Center, where it will be
                    returned days later, professionally cleaned and folded!

                    Lugging a fridge and microwave to campus can be a real drag,
                    especially if you’re coming from far away. Instead, have a
                    high-quality fridge/freezer and microwave delivered right to
                    your dorm! Microfridges are available for purchase or rental,
                    are very affordable, and are a dorm essential. Split the cost with
                    your roommate and ensure that you’ll have Brown-approved
                    fridge to keep your drinks cold and a powerful microwave to
                    make some late-night popcorn! Read more on our website and

                    Instead of running around town trying to find all of the
                    necessary linens for your room, buy them all within minutes
                    online, and have them shipped directly to either your home or to
                    Brown (where you can pick them up upon arrival). These linens are
                    affordable, designed to fit the mattresses at Brown, and guaranteed
                    to last until graduation. So don’t wait—you can buy all of your
                    dorm room essentials online today, from sheets and comforters to
                    towels, mattress pads, and room decor! You’ll save 20% by being a
                    Brown student, and you’ll ensure that your room is as comfortable
                    as possible. Read more on our website and order today!
