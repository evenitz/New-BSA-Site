      <p>Founded in 2011 by Tara Noble '12.5 and Hannah Winkler '13, The Vault is a student-run upcycling initiative that facilitiates exchange of goods, skills, and ideas in the Brown Community.</p>
				<p>The Vault holds regular sale days on campus and accepts donations of gently used clothing, accessories, and small household items. Donors receive 50% of their donation value in never-expiring store credit.</p>
				<p>Profits from sales go towards employment and funding for free workshops that promote environmental causes. Past workshops have taught students to transform old T-shirts, create homemade halloween costumes, and keep warm in the winter with the smallest ecological footprint possible.</p>
